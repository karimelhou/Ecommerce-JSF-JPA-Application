# E-commerce Application (JSF & JPA)

## Summary
This repository hosts the codebase for an E-commerce application developed using JavaServer Faces (JSF) and Java Persistence API (JPA). The application is designed to facilitate product management, user interactions, and order processing for an online shopping platform. This README provides an overview of the project structure and key features.

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to create a functional E-commerce platform that allows users to browse, search, purchase products, and manage their shopping carts. The application leverages the power of JSF for creating a dynamic web interface and JPA for efficient data modeling and database interactions.

## Modelization
The project begins with a detailed class diagram that defines the essential entities, their attributes, and relationships within the E-commerce application. These entities include Product, User, ShoppingCart, CartItem, Order, OrderItem, Category, and Payment.

## Entities
The application comprises various entities such as Product, User, ShoppingCart, CartItem, Order, OrderItem, Category, and Payment. Each entity is thoroughly documented, describing its attributes and relationships within the application.

## Beans
Managed bean classes, such as ProductBean, ShoppingCartBean, and CategoryBean, play a crucial role in managing specific functionality within the application. They are responsible for interacting with the user interface and the database, ensuring seamless data management.

## JSF Views
The project includes various JavaServer Faces (JSF) views that create an interactive and user-friendly web interface for the application. The views facilitate tasks such as product search, creation, and modification.
